The click-through rate (CTR) prediction model is an essential tool for online advertisers to
estimate the likelihood of a user clicking on an advertisement. This model uses machine
learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and predict the probability of clicks on an ad. The
model is trained on historical data that includes the ad's features, such as the ad's text, image,
and placement, as well as the user's features, such as demographic information, search
queries, and browsing history.
